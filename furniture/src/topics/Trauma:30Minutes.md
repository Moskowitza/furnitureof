# Trauma: 30 Minutes?

Is there a solution for communities where infrastructure and services are limited.

## Trauma Response

The writers admit they had a hard time with conducting research so they settled on an [article](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/03/25/2-investigators-bga-ambulance-response-times-getting-worse-as-memo-aims-to-quiet-dispatchers/) from Chicago CBS local.

There is a drawing of an ambulance of the future equipped with a drone and widescreen tv. I imagine this is a proposal from Xzibit.

This section fails to acknowledge some basic facts about ambulances which are often owned & operated by fire departments or private companies. They are dispatched for a range of situations, typically competing after a 911 call. After all, ambulances are expensive assets for the companies that operate them. A fleet of autonomous high-tech ambulances roaming the streets, possibly with a team on board, waiting for a stroke or falling anvil would require an inversion of this business model.

Hospitals already prepare for patients coming in on an ambulance. A national command center of specialized trauma team sitting around waiting to make decisions for a local hospital about a patient they haven't seen yet doesn't sound futuristic but rather a poor use of human resources. ERs already have specialized scheduling software that helps staff coordinate the ER and allow the doctors to manage themselves.

## Trauma Timeline

Leaping off from the Chicago report we get a short story about a shooting victim. Here's a more optimistic and no less fantastical story... Nobody gets shot. The 30 year-old male doesn't shoot himself. He never developed the insecurities that lead to gun ownership because his healthcare, education, financial and spiritual needs are met.

## I've fallen and I can't get up

A geriatric woman at high risk of a heart attack suffers a heart attack! She has a sensor in her Propet orthopaedics that connects to her 5G network that sounds the alarms. An algorithm sends a specialized heart-attack team (certainly not the stroke or cardiac arrest team). Since they don't have to watch the road they can review her medical history. They arrive a minute and a half later, a full minute after the drones but still a minute before the woman answers the door. Instead of reviewing Dr. Scholl's EKG report or her blood O2, the paramedics review an image and administer the medication that she should have been taking in the first place. A home health aide sits with the woman for the next 2 weeks before her doctor can see her in person.

All this because the woman would not or could not take an Aspirin without an EMT present. Sadly, it's time to move to assisted living.
