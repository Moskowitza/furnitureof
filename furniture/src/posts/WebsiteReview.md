Notes, the site looks great. and I like the use of setting up separate topics. But there are 14 chapters sections that don't help. One is simply called "Previvors" and another "The Art of Making A Baby". Is this a new Cards against Humanity Deck? Perhaps this is not the best place to start so I'll read those later.

- Solving The Puzzle:
- This is the mission statement, the report will discuss the role of Western NY in health care's evolution. There conciliatory comment about not being Silicon Valley. Dr. Hopkins' and Dr. Siddiqui's puzzle to be solved is how will medical centers, specifically Buffalo, out innovate external competition and keep customers. A frightening position for a regional healthcare provider to be in, but here we are.

[Chairman's Leter](http://futureof.org/medicine-1-0/about/chairmans-letter/)
I don't know why mil-lions is hyphenated but this is a heartfelt letter and speaks to a higher mission of making improvements through innovation. I would be embarrassed to leave a typo in the letter written by the person who paid for this project.

[Prediction Array](http://futureof.org/medicine-1-0/about/prediction-array/)
Something to mark your calendars for. We're provided with 5-7 predictions for five, 10, 20 years out. This can provide some insight into what the authors think are important. Let's look at the first two arrays to see what the writers find prescient.
The Future is Now
01-Neurosurgery
02-Hospital Managment
03-Patient Advocacy/social networking
04-Application of CRISPR
05-Medical Education
06-Payment Models

5-Years
01-Genetic Testing of Embryos
02-Changes in regulation because of pricing pressure, (this is bold, because there is nofuckingway congress will be granting the FDA more powers in the next two years and that those changes would be in adopted in less than 5. Absolutely interested in reading more about this, could have been a safer 10year prediction)
03-Centralized monitoring of patients(I'll look for clarity in the report. I have many questions on what this looks like).
04-Immunotherapy will take over for Chemotherapy. This feels like it can be true.
05-More robotic surgery and introduction of autonomous robots. Feels likely.
06-New ways to read and write medical information. Citing specific technologies, AR headsets and natural language's role in data entry, will mean they'll likely miss the mark.
07-Again over specific, but we're almost guaranteed see continued reduction automobile related deaths and injury.

This is fun, so let's keep going: The year is 2028(I'm writing this in 2019, but this is a 2018 report)
01-Think of a 60yo today, who can't use google maps, being told by their Dr in 10 years that they need to watch a light show in their VR headset. Yeah...
02-Parabiosis like we're dancing around stonehenge. But ok, maybe something like that.
03-Improved personalized drug screening. I would hope so.
04-Regrowing cartilage, A favorite for a list like this.
05-Fewer back surgery. Absolutely. But for the following reasons: We'll screen patients better, I've met my share of people who's biggest regret in life is having a spine surgery. People will be in overall better health, having less back pain. More affordable options will be pursued for a longer period of time.

20 years: Oh god I'll be 60. These sound fun but I'm having a hard time seeing 20 year predictions being part of the discussion of the mission statement.

01-We will trade yearly shots for implants. I don't know, flu shots feels more about public/global health. Who exactly is getting these?
02-Magneto will clear arterial plaque and the Beast will cure baldness and Professor X will be everyone's therapist. COOL!
03-Open-source EMR. THIS is incredible that a technology that has existed for over 40 years will take 20 more years to be adopted. This is the Whiteflag of the report.
04-Safer Organ Transplants due to improved immunotherapies. This is solid and probably not 20years out.
05-Medicine looks more like construction. I don't remember ever seeing an Academic Medical Center that hasn't looked like it's under construction. See you later Medtronic and Mayo Clinic, hello Black+Decker and Home Depot.

Summary: No comments on topics driving national dialogue: Cost & Access, disease eradication, obesity, mental health or addiction.

[Editor's Letter](http://futureof.org/medicine-1-0/about/editors-letter/)
What's this section... they can lower their max-width on the page. . . . blah blah...
Here we go, something about the report:
However, we’d recommend starting with the _Forces of Change_, which lays out the technological and social currents we see shaping the future landscape. Then, to get an idea of our methodology, read on to _Prediction Array_ for a set of example scenarios and a description of how our team goes about probing the future. After that, dive into the main sections of the report, _letting your curiosity_ be your guide.

# The Team

[The Team](http://futureof.org/medicine-1-0/about/the-team/)
About the team behind the future of medicine website and report. I'll try to get a copy of this to each one of them.

# Opportunities

[Opportunities](http://futureof.org/medicine-1-0/about/opportunities/)
I'm rescinding my comments about how the site looks, my eyes crossed over reading the top headlines and my mind melted as I contemplated the first sentence "Wherever you already are an innovator and market leader, double down" Wherever... whoa. And the next sentence tells me how to be excellent. GTFO.

I think I need to read this section after the report. The platitudes and advice seem divergent with my understanding of healthcare. I thought this would be a section of opportunities, not conflicting advice.

"Establish a strategic task force in your community among healthcare stake-holders." "If you don’t have a med-tech incubator, start one. If there’s already one in town, start another." Again, GTFO.

"MAKE VIRTUAL MEDICINE REALITY" Go ahead, read that out loud and listen. You'll be the second one to do so.

EMBRACE AI
This whole page makes me think it was written by AI. I use an AI to help with my writing it's called Grammerly. It's free and would catch things like an extra space in "non- clinical."

Any literate person knows my writing isn't perfect either but I also don't have a team. Fuck, I'm not even being paid.

Lastly, don't describe a patient population as a group to be marketed to, and certainly don't do it in a document about revenue growth strategies, and then definitely don't publish that on the internet. You look like a bunch of dicks.

# Policy Review

Thank God they fixed the headers issue that's the Opportunities section. Oh FUCK, there it is at the end of the page.

As to the content.

I have yet to read a worse editorial on healthcare policy, and I read David Brooks columns. I agree with the general statement that the crux of healthcare policy is how we, as a society, make decisions on how to provide a limited resource. The nuance there flew right over the writer's head and whittled down to a false trade off of cost vs quality.

There are factually incorrect statements, over simplifications (i'm being generous, it's bullshit) and fiction in the remaining paragraphs. There are no citations or analysis. There are no real world examples. There simply is no there-there. Mother-fucker didn't even put his name on it. I don't have a Master's in Health Policy but I bet there are individuals at the University of Buffalo that do who are probably depressed when they see this crap associated with their school.

Here's a prediction! Preexisting conditions will not be "laughed" in the future. Maybe I'm wrong, after all who doesn't like a good joke about inequality. The writer hasn't been informed that the problem with having a "preexisting condition" is a total failing of our private insurance system and utterly confuses the issue with preventative care. Again, the writer favored bullshit over contributing to the conversation.

I'm going to stop and leave with this

Donald Trump once said, "Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated." The nation laughed, but now I see the source of confusion.
