Remember that scene in Idiocray where Luke Wilson goes to Carl's Jr for health care. Yeah, that.

So to the thesis of the work! Creative Destruction of Healthcare. Oh, also not the very popular Eric Topol book.
This section has lists of things related to access of care, such as getting more doctors to practice in your area, telehealth, and drug delivery.

## Instant Access

Ooh...
Hopkins has a 22 screen command Center, maybe they'll move it to the Newseum

Also in this section:
People buy stupid shit that they think will help.
"Instant-Access Medicine will help restore trust in the system, simply by eliminating these vulnerable waiting phases. Patients will feel more empowered to get consultations and results and interventions at a pace they control."

I think the connection is week and people will keep buying shit that is marketed to them.

## 2 big trends

Hospital Buyouts
Employer Self-funding

Absolutely, these are big trends and the reason for the paper. Shit, are we already moving on?

## The Benefit of Being Bigger

Yeah, hence Hospital Buyouts and why all industries have seen consolidation.

## The Benefit of Being Agile.

Wait, so be Big or Agile? These examples are mostly very specific in what they do.
