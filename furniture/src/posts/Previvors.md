## genes and future illness

If I was Buffalo I wouldn't worry about this. Determining genetic risk for a disease won' change the fundamentals of the market. Early detection isn't some holy grail, it creates a lot of complicated problems. Treating or even over observing asymptomatic people is no cure all. We're not new to this, I really wouldn't over sell the idea that our healthcare system will get good at it.
