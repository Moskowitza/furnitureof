Innovation Assures Future of Medicine in Buffalo is Bright

- purpose was to look at technological and socioeconomic forces that are most likely to have an impact on health care.

  - Separation of Technology and SE forces into two categories

“There were a lot of downward trends — such as obesity, job loss predicted due to automation, and an overall crisis in physician morale,” McHugh added. “It was a pretty daunting set of realities at the outset.”

"What was surprising to us was that some of the most novel things we learned along the way were right here in Western New York,” McHugh said. “The negative scenarios we started out turned into positives when we took into account the technological innovations that are occurring.”

~It is not surprising that innovation would try to solve problems. ~

To Dr. Nelson's point that innovation needs infrastructure and People. Buffalo's population trend has been declining [population](http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/buffalo-population/)Further for Buffalo, growth and investment do lay in the hands of UB/Kaleida as the cities largest employer.
I hope this is an advantage, where UB successfully develops, and nurtures home-grown solutions and demand tailoring of external products and services.

-- Promise of Data

“We want to understand who needs treatment and who doesn’t,” he said. “The human mind can only handle so much information. We can perhaps consider six to eight variables at a time. Computers can take into account millions.”

“We can use data to predict things such as who is going to have a stroke, who is going to recover from a stroke and what interventions are going to be successful, so resources can best be allocated,” Davies said.

~ I feel that there is something disingenuous about statements like these. I'm sure Dr. Davies knows that ML has limitations. Comparing healthcare to retail or other industries, like retail, also seems counter productive to an argument for the use of analytics. Amazon sales and distribution is entirely too shallow, the differences are obvious and the similarities are strained.

“What we are trying to do at the JI is optimize the opportunities that already exist here. We are not trying to reinvent any unique structure,” he said. “The talent that we have here in Buffalo is good enough to match any other place on the planet.”

  ~ I agree with Dr. Siddiqui, UB's strength is in it's differentiation and specialization.
