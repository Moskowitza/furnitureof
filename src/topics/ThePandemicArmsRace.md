## The Pandemic Arms Race

Querying images with GraphQL allows you to access the image’s data as well as perform transformations with Sharp, a high-performance image processing library.

You’ll need a few plugins for this:

gatsby-source-filesystem plugin allows you to query files with GraphQL
gatsby-plugin-sharp powers the connections between Sharp and Gatsby Plugins
gatsby-transformer-sharp allows you to create multiples images of the right sizes and resolutions with a query
