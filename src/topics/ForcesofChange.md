## Presentation Overview

That graphic is pretty dope.

## methodology

Ok, some methodology:
Authors picked 26 technologies and asked _some number_ of futurists to rank them form 1-10.

- Eleven of these forces are new medical technologies
- Seven of the forces are computing technologies
- Eight are global sociodemographic forces

And there is a list of 26 'technologies'

Wait, was there supposed to be a graph or ranking?

Let's assume the fururists are the people quoted in the rest of the doc

I think we will have a few mega-brands, like Johns Hopkins and Mayo, across many states and internationally. Other brands will be successful by focusing on their specialty expertise, such as cancer care. It will be a mistake to confine any healthcare organization to just the US market.

You’ve gotta be able to hunt. You should eat what you kill. Train your own workforce to do it your way. I have to compete with Walmart, where even Medicaid patients are happy to pay \$30 in cash out of pocket.
