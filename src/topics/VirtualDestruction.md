Remember that scene in Idiocracy where Luke Wilson goes to the hospital. Yeah.

So to the thesis of the work! Creative Destruction of Healthcare. Oh, also not the very popular Eric Topol book.
This section has lists of things related to access of care, such as getting more doctors to practice in your area, telehealth, and drug delivery.

## Instant Access

Ooh...
Hopkins has a 22 screen command Center, maybe they'll move it to the Newseum

Also in this section:
People buy stupid shit that they think will help.
"Instant-Access Medicine will help restore trust in the system, simply by eliminating these vulnerable waiting phases. Patients will feel more empowered to get consultations and results and interventions at a pace they control."

I think the connection is week and people will keep buying shit that is marketed to them.

## 2 Big Trends

Hospital Buyouts
Employer Self-funding

Absolutely, these are big trends and the reason for the paper. Thank you for the bullet points.

## The Benefit of Being Bigger

Yeah, all industries have seen consolidation in this late capitalism American. I think this is what the JI wished to have addressed in this report, "how to get bigger". There are many directions to grow and efficiencies to be made. Unfortunately, we don't get an answer here or elsewhere in the report.

## The Benefit of Being Agile.

I think the suggestion here is Kaleida can install bigger windows, lower their hospital infection rates, and then sell them to Apple. I'm just kidding, there are no coherent suggestions or a illuminating ideas in this section.
